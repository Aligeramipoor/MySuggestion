Lisa Olson, FanHouse: "How can anyone with a conscience ever again hire Williams in any capacity? He shouldn't be allowed near the water bottles, never mind humans who prefer their body parts kept relatively intact. Make no mistake, for every Frank Gore's head or Michael Crabtree's leg, there are other craniums and ACLs on which Williams drew specific bull's-eyes. . . .

On it Williams, then the Saints defensive coordinator who has been suspended indefinitely as part of the larger inquiry, is heard imploring his players to maim specific opponents by targeting specific body parts. He did this AFTER the league had told the Saints they were being investigated for engaging in illegal pay-to-injure schemes, proving Williams' hubris stretches beyond what we thought was just a normal King of the World conceit."

This would make it more difficult for foreign countries to cut production to force up prices. The potentially unreliable countries of North Africa and the Persian Gulf, Venezuela and Nigeria supply a combined total of 5 million barrels a day -- about a quarter of U.S. consumption.

"This minor complaint has been turned into a political tactic to tarnish my campaign credibility with the general public," Menard said. "This triumvirate that is made up of two attorneys has labeled me guilty before being proven innocent - the opposite of what our judicial system is based on."

"I don't know. I don't have the crystal ball. We know what we think. We're going to continue to see them battle and work at it. We're going to focus on day to day getting better. Does that mean we have to adjust and do some things? I think the most important thing, talking about the quarterback position, whether it's offense or defense, we got to find a way to get our best 11 on the field.

In 2010, she missed a progress hearing because she claimed her passport had been stolen while at the Cannes Film Festival, and from there things snowballed: Probation violation, another brief jail stint, rehab, failed drug test, probation violation, rehab. She started to mix it up bit: Alleged attack on a Betty Ford Clinic worker! Grand theft larceny accusations from a Venice, Calif., jewelry store! Then back to the grind: Probation violation, house arrest, failed alcohol test, probation violation, brief jail stint, missed therapy sessions, MIA for community service, brief jail stint. That's when Sautner instituted the timetable that seemed to get Lohan back on track.
This is the same argument Mal Nesheim and I used in our book, "Feed Your Pet Right." If American pets were not fed byproducts of human food production, they would need the equivalent of food for 42 million people.
"Women may be born and bred to be compassionate, but they're also hard-wired to be self-critical," writes Fain in The Huffington Post. "Dieting only makes matters worse.

"It's difficult to say this without seeming self-involved, but really, primarily, what I care about is making people laugh. When it's my job, then I do feel pressure to perform — a professional duty. It can be exhausting. But I'm happy to be able to have quiet and intelligent conversation. In the past, I didn't have an off switch as much. But now, because I'm focused on work, and there are different kinds of dimensions to my life, I don't have that tendency."

There's two or three different routes I’d go. One is to get together with a buddy who can code a little and make an iPhone game. It doesn't need to set the world on fire, but it shows that you can make decisions and see a project to completion. So many amateurs start working, then get bored or distracted. Seeing someone finish a project is huge. I would also become super active in the gaming community online. We’ve hired people who ran fan sites, and they’ve become spokespeople for our games in their own right, by corralling peoples’ attention just through being a superuser. Blizzard in particular promotes a lot from within.

Not surprisingly, turning the straight inspired Gagne to move all in, leading to an instant call from Juttelstad that would make him the champion after the river came 8s. Gagne was doomed when the ace hit the board, and the only real strategic question is what's the best method of getting her money in. (Some would say she should check and give Juttelstad an opportunity to bluff, since he is almost never calling an all-in with a worse hand.)

You don't want to blast Candlestick for being an older building because there have been a lot of great moments there, but the new building is going to be a completely different experience. Instead of just making a nice hot dog, you can do 20 to 30 different items. It'll probably be a 50 percent quicker exit than what you see at Candlestick. You can't compete with that, being able to park easily and get to your car and out onto the freeway quicker or take public transit.

In the vaguest of terms, there's a similarity to Rowling's saga. Morgenstern's novel also centers on two dueling magicians, one of whom is difficult to pin down by name. The pawns in their odd, extended game are several sweet, young innocents who struggle to uncover their own destinies just like Harry and his friends. And the drama takes place among an interesting assortment of characters populating the Cirque des Rêves, which does seem, a little, like Hogwarts.

Mr. Blackwell says his work isn't so foreign that locals can't relate to it. "They see it and think it looks strangely familiar," he says.

Our endorsement comes after discussions with city officials and finance experts who assured us this was no back-door scheme to privatize city assets. They also convinced us that many potential trust deals - such as retrofitting buildings to be more energy efficient - probably couldn't be done with traditional public financing. In many instances, the city still will use traditional municipal bonds, but privately financed deals open up a new world of capital. Though they potentially feature higher interest rates, they bring efficiencies and better allocation of risk that could drive down costs.

"I had a couple of easy birdies," Dufner said. "I don’t think I missed a fairway or a green. Just had some tough reads. The greens are kind of tough to read. Sometimes you get competing grains, competing slopes, so you get a putt that might break to the right, but the grain is going left. That can be kind of difficult to judge. Then 18, I had just a really good number for my 5-wood to get somewhere on that green and had a putt that was down grain and breaking to the left with the grain, so that was a nice way to finish the day."

Now, instead of driving to a branch, I use the bank's app to take a picture of checks that I'm sent and "phone in" my deposits.

(On if the West Coast offense looks he wants it to and where he would want it to go)- "There's room for improvement. I think part of that had to do with the offseason not being able to use it. I think some of the things we do are okay. Are we all a little frustrated by our offense right now? Yeah, I think so, but am I surprised? No, it did take some time to really time this thing out. As I mentioned earlier, because we're young I suspect as the season goes along and every time they get one more game under their belt, one more game under their belt, listen to this, practice this, same plays and all that, that you should see a little bit more of an offense with a little more timing, a little more fluidness to it. You've seen this system work before and it works. It just takes some time to get on the same page. I think we were hurt just a little bit by what happened in the offseason, like a lot of teams. You can see it every once in a while out there."

Those that say home ownership should be a thing of the past only have dollar signs in their eyes. They make the mistake of thinking the only reason people aspire to be homeowners is the dream of making a killing when they sell their home someday. Or, they want to be able to utilize the equity they build in their homes to finance the luxuries of life. While this attitude by some contributed to our economic challenges, the truth is home ownership was never meant to be a get-rich-quick scheme.

Adam: This contest is a legitimate dream match for me as a wrestling fan. I've long been a fan of both men, so the prospect of seeing them face off on the grandest stage of all is an amazing feel. I, too, expect this match to be the best of the night from an in-ring standpoint and just hope it will be alloted enough time to truly become something special, a WrestleMania classic for the ages. While I still don't feel the addition of Punk's family crises was necessary, it helps add to this feud, which I believe is only getting started. Punk and Jericho are too good a pairing to only have one match, and ultimately, I believe Jericho will sneak out with the win and the WWE title. Jericho will be able to gloat and carry the mantle of "best in the world" right into a series of rematches.

One good measure of valuation is the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio: the value of the company divided by its earnings, or how much money it makes after it pays for its costs. P/E is a good measure of valuation because P/E tells you how much investors expect the company to grow in the future. (This is because what an asset is worth is, in theory at least, the "net present value of its future cash flows", or how much you're paying now for the money it's going to make in the future. So the higher the P/E ratio, the more money you expect the company to make in the future.)

Supporters of Proposition 29 say that voters want to see a strong relationship between a special tax and how it's spent. Cigarettes cause cancer, heart disease and lung problems, so it makes sense to use the tax to find out more about those diseases. To paraphrase "Thre Mikado," whose "object all sublime" was to "let the punishment fit the crime," the idea is that the object must be to let the benefit fit the tax.

To which I reply: At any given time, the TV schedule has considerable acreage of vast wasteland, to dust off another vintage expression. But the mere existence of such intelligence-insulting sideshows as "Toddlers & Tiaras" doesn't somehow transform "Mad Men," "Justified," "Community" or any number of terrific series into toxic byproducts.

This charming kid’s-eye movie, full of comical and vivid detail about the lives of these cheerful children, has the loose, lanky feel of a memoir and of French New Wave films. Writer-director Taika Waititi, who also plays the exasperating, inept and semi-lovable dad, adroitly mixes pathos with absurdity.

"Judging by newspaper headlines of the early 1930s, popular wisdom viewed economics through a biblical lens: recessions were the wages of sin. When good times lasted too long, businesses and individuals threw caution to the wind and behaved badly. Recessions ... occurred when private businesses and households unwound past excesses, wrote off bad investments, and behaved with restraint once again. ... (Recessions) were regrettable but necessary correctives, like a detox program for a drunk."
He knows. He's been there before. We've all seen it. There were a lot of stadium staffers and fans walking around after Friday's game going, "Another trip to Pasadena, not bad at all."

A funny thing happened while MIT researchers were testing the effects of yogurt on obese mice -- unexpected side effects sprouted up. First, yogurt-fed mice developed thick, shiny fur, with 10 times the hair-follicle density of their yogurt-deprived counterparts. And then researchers noticed that their fur wasn't all that seemed fuller. The yogurt-eating males held their whiskers high and proudly displayed their testes, which were about 15 percent heavier than males being fed low-nutrient (junk) food. The yogurt-eating males also inseminated their partners faster (and yogurt-eating females gave birth to larger and more successful litters).

But this game also could become something entirely different if a proposed three-team deal involving New Jersey, Denver and Detroit goes through.

Another possibility is instituting combined reporting measures to plug corporate tax loopholes. Now, multi-state corporations can avoid paying Missouri corporate income tax by headquartering in another state and funneling profits there.

For a few years, that particular Burger King was an extremely popular hang out for mid-county high schoolers of my era.

_ WILL WASHINGTON WIN THE NL EAST? All eyes are on Bryce Harper, Stephen Strasburg and the Nationals right now. They're fresh, fun and full of rising talent. Plus, they're winning minus injured closer Drew Storen. Manager Davey Johnson provides a steady hand, and the Nats will do OK while Jayson Werth's broken wrist heals. The last time a baseball team from the nation's capital reached the postseason was 1933, when FDR was in office. It might be time for President Barack Obama to begin warming up his left arm.

Here he is in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11: "We are apparently supposed to shut up and eat our spinach. Asking questions, proposing alternatives, making distinctions, arguing analogies, remembering history, or criticizing our stand-tall President is, for the moment, unpatriotic and maybe even unmanly. Wave that flag, stuff that qualm." And yet, even in that moment, he can't stop looking to the writers, to literature as a counter-force. "Grace Paley, on the other wonderful hand," he enthuses a few lines later, "suggests … that we bomb Afghanistan with three tons of wheat, rye, and rice, since they are starving: 'If we do it with a vicious attitude, maybe that will be enough for some people.'"

That's doubly impressive when you consider the odds against this business, which has been open since 1999. It's in a "tourist" area near Fisherman's Wharf, where many locals don't venture, and the menu is fixed-price, which until recently many soothsayers said was a dinosaur. You still have the luxury amenities other restaurants forgo, including tablecloths and a cheese cart. And it's expensive.

He said he could not even sell it to me on a prescription and that I would have to get it at a drug store. At that time, this was 15 or 20 blocks from the fire. Went to Dr. Leithead who gave me a prescription, and then I got the wine at the drug store.

Suddes lamented the loss of rebels who he says are being shown the door due to term limits. I would submit that a more likely culprit of legislative ills and fewer rebels is the aggressive actions taken by both the Republican and Democratic parties to handpick candidates and involve themselves in primaries to ensure their guy or gal wins.

KGO also is unlikely to report on the doings of the departed hosts. At press time, two of the seven who were let go Dec. 1 had landed new jobs, and two others were in touch with various stations. (Besides Gross and Rothmann, pink slips went to Gene Burns, Len Tillem, Ray Taliaferro, Joanie Greggains and Dr. Bill Wattenburg.) On Tuesday, Tillem, the attorney who does his weekday advice show out of Sonoma, began broadcasting on the new KKSF (910 AM), from 3 to 4 p.m. He was followed by Burns, whose program goes from 4 to 7 p.m., and whose weekly "Dining Around" show will air on Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., as it had on KGO since 1995.

Because this was a time before regulations prevented polluting of waterways, Jersey City developed for the towns a sewage-treatment plant in Boonton that was completed in 1925 and expanded in 1953. By the early 1960s, Jersey City sought payments to offset rising costs of treating sewage, but the towns refused. That led to a series of protracted legal battles and settlements periodically over the next 20 years.
While its rivals stay afloat with billions in government aid, Ford grabbed a bigger slice of the American car market in April with record sales of its fuel-efficient Fusion. Those results pushed it past Toyota to retake its post as the nation's No. 2 car seller.

The paintings that would cause the greatest controversy and personal pain were mostly of Hindu deities. Although they were painted in the early 1970s, they didn't get much attention until 1996, when a monthly Hindi magazine, Vichar Mimansa, printed them, leading to several lawsuits by outraged conservatives. Two years later, his house was attacked by Hindu groups who vandalized several of his works.
But, what's this? Perhaps Tustin was just a decoy. From the sound of it, the main enemy effort must be to take Disneyland. From the intensity of the fire to be heard from there, the enemy must be scaling the walls of the Happiest Place on Earth itself. How ignominious and perfidious are the intentions of these profane invaders.

In the film based on the Grimm fairy tale, he plays a man of the forest who puts his ax to good use and engages in fisticuffs.

Her pop star older sister casts a large shadow, but Knowles has tried to stay out of it, forging her own music career as well as a fashion presence that leans more toward downtown chic than Beyoncé's va-va voom.

Last year, Hyman suggested City Colleges reconsider its open-enrollment policy because many of its students needed remedial classes to prepare for college-level work.

Our changing stateColorado's 1960 population was 1.8 million; now we've passed 5.1 million. The state covers 66.3 million acres, or 104,247 square miles. Forty-two percent of that is public land — city, county, state and national. In 1962, we had 39.9 million acres of privately owned farms and ranches creating the legendary Western landscape; today it's 31.3 million acres. We've lost 8.6 million acres of ag land, the open space we crave, and food producers. (A hopeful note: more than 1.8 million acres of open space, primarily farms and ranches, are now protected by conservation easements against development.)

Use all your senses: Judging beer is a science, and Pat Daniels -- one of the most knowledgeable tasters around -- offers an excellent guide: bjcp.org/docs/How_to_Judge_Beer.pdf. "All five human senses can and should be used when judging officially or casually," says Daniels, a bartender at McNulty's Bier Markt. And yes, that includes hearing: "I know what you're thinking. How can one's ears contribute to the overall beer-tasting experience? When judging or casually drinking from beer poured from the bottle, I have started the process with many styles such as a highly carbonated Belgian Gueuze and Tripel that should present the sound of massive amounts of CO2 escaping from the bottle (like popping champagne) after being opened. Unfortunately, my ears are the first to detect that such a bottle has gone flat and lost this sought-after carbonation that helps makes the style."

This won’t exactly curdle your coffee, but we’ll mention it anyway. This is who they are now, and for the foreseeable future. The Giants are not only flawed, at times they’re comically flawed.

Ms. Suu Kyi's comments go the heart of a central question asked by international leaders—whether a range of liberalizing moves over the past year by Myanmar's government are genuine and likely to survive over the long term. Western governments are closely watching Sunday's vote, which will fill around 45 of the more than 600 seats in Myanmar's parliament, as an indicator of whether to begin easing major economic sanctions in place for years to punish Myanmar's secretive military regime. U.S. and European leaders have said they would be willing to lift some sanctions soon, possibly as early as next month, if the vote is seen as free and fair.

Afghanistan has been mostly out of the headlines the last few months, in part because its winter freezes most fighting and in part because it's been overshadowed by the Arab revolutions.

The poor Red Sox must have felt like they were facing two aces today. First was the Verlander who relied heavily on his slider as he went through the Red Sox lineup. Then came the Verlander who complements his high-90s heat with nasty curveballs. He threw two straight curves to Red Sox shortstop Mike Aviles in the eighth inning that were so good, they were almost offensive. Aviles somehow managed to hit the second one for a soft lineout to shortstop. I might give Aviles some All-Star votes for that.

The football-shaped fruit is 6 to 14 inches long, with a gooey pulp protecting 25 to 50 bitter white seeds that turn brown when exposed to air. It takes about 200 beans to make one pound. Most of Mexico's chocolate now is grown in Tabasco and Chiapas states.

It's highly unusual for a car rental company to charge an extra driver fee for a spouse, but such a surcharge isn't illegal. It is something of a money grab, though. Does it cost the car rental company more if your wife, brother or son drives your rental? No. Will your car insurance cover damage to the vehicle if it's damaged? Check with your insurance company, but I've never heard of an "extra driver" fee having any relevance in a claim that involves a driver's insurance company.

The latest edition of Baseball America paints a devastating picture of the Sox' lack of commitment to the international market (especially when compared to the Rangers).

Pitching: Jolene Henderson was Pac-10 Pitcher of the Year as a sophomore last season with a 40-10 record and 0.99 ERA.

The Republicans stand for smaller government, to let people keep more of their hard-earned money and work their way up the ladder of prosperity. The American dream is to be self-sufficient, entrepreneurial and productive in our great society. To be sure, we all need to help the truly needy along the way to success, but when people take from the successful (rich) and give to the poor, they ruin the incentive of both.

Dinner? It's hit or miss. The steak is fair. The risotto is edible, bordering on OK. So is the sea bass (served whole) if your preference is for doing all your own seasoning at the table. The braised lamb shank may have been the best meal we had, tender and and properly seasoned, suggesting that a modicum of patience and skill is somewhere to be found in the kitchen. I just know it won't be a lasting memory, like, say, the lamb at Boulevard Bistro.

In technology, size isn't always an asset, as HP is learning. One of the biggest challenges for Whitman will be to figure out how big HP needs to be. It's a key question that has tripped up a string of CEOs, from Carly Fiorina and her hard-fought battle to buy Compaq Computer, to Mark Hurd and his $20 billion acquisition spree and 50,000 job cuts, and Apotheker's poorly received plan to steer HP away from lower-margin areas of computer hardware.

Opponents say that allowing Wegmans to have a liquor store would lead to other grocery chains angling for one, and that would be the death of small, family-owned liquor stores. In arguments reminiscent of those used by mom-and-pop shops when Walmart and other big-box stores come to town, the merchants say they cannot compete with the prices and selection that the chains can offer.

Sheamus and Daniel Bryan finally had the match fans have been waiting for, and it did not disappoint. Iin the match of the night, both men delivered great twists and turns, with Bryan garnering much of the attention (and fan support) from the Chicago crowd. After Bryan deliberately got himself disqualified after failing to respond to a ref's 5 count leading to the first fall, Bryan locked in the “Yes” lock, leading to fall No. 2 after Sheamus passed out. Once he came to, a rehash of WrestleMania's 18-second match seemed to be the path for fall No. 3, but Bryan kicked out. Eventually, a second Brogue Kick would seal the deal. Though Bryan doesn't hold the World Heavyweight title, he proved that he is a champion in terms of someone who can be counted on to always be one half of a fantastic match in big-stage situations.

As it got dark, I wondered how we were going to get home. This felt oddly similar to the walks we took as kids, but this time if we were to call our parents to pick us up, I am sure they would laugh at us, then scream when the international charges showed up on the next phone bill.

And there's Perry, Bachmann and Santorum -- who has pretty much lived in Iowa since last summer and admits he's through if Tuesday goes badly.

That's a very big slice of Iowa's GOP base -- but not split three ways.

More teams using multiple running backs has devalued the position making the big-time, every-down back increasingly rare. But it also has expanded the net for the type of backs a team is willing to take on. That wider net includes shorter, quicker backs overlooked 30 years ago.

Photo equipment. Keep it simple, but bring some extra digital cards and an extra battery or two. In Yosemite Valley, you can buy extra cards at the Ansel Adams Gallery and at the store, but they’re expensive and sometimes not in stock. I usually pack two tripods: a larger, heavier-duty tripod that can extend and support my telephoto lenses and a smaller one that can be easily strapped to my backpack. A cable release is also a must. Some of the exposures are long, and you don’t want to touch the camera or cause any vibration that will make the picture look out of focus.

Didn't civic leaders learn from last fall's St. Louis-centric special session, when the "China Hub" proposal failed? In the Legislature, this city has a target on its back. It's hard enough to get local leaders unified behind a project, let alone build a legislative coalition behind something important to the St. Louis region.
Season 10 winner Patrick House looked trim and terrific, and Season 12 winner John Rhodes was there as well. He has gained some of the weight back, a mild paunch, but otherwise looks like he is doing a good job maintaining. When I saw him, he was walking alone (his wife following along behind.)

The guides were controversial all over the country, of course. Some politicians, even Democrats, thought the writers' project was a Communist plot. And as it's revealed on the title page, "Los Angeles" was co-sponsored by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, maybe we should be grateful that what we got is as good as it is. The guide remains addictively readable and features, as Kipen notes, sheaves of "dazzling monochrome photography" from the likes Julius Shulman and Fred William Carter. It's still alive and has become big history in the debate it set out to report, the one that asks the questions: What exactly is L.A., and whither goes it?

Legislation introduced late last month by Sen. Joe Pennacchio (R-Morris) places some of the burden on the future unemployed. The bill, which formalizes Gov. Chris Christie’s earlier proposal, would reduce weekly unemployment checks by $50 to a maximum of $550. Furloughed employees would take a big hit because the law would include a one-week waiting period for people receiving benefits. It would prevent such employees from collecting unemployment during the first week they are out of work.

"We find those kids quickly and plug them in," Kinch said.
FitzGerald and Mason deny any such alliance.
Create new training programs at some state community colleges to train people to work in the energy industry.
One problem with this strategy is that those laws are barely adequate to police misuse of large sums by politicians running for office, much less politicians running around. What prosecutors will try to do is show that Edwards' real purpose was to keep his secret from voters, not from his wife, with money subject to disclosure and other laws.
In March election filings, Ready listed Harry Hughes as his campaign treasurer. Hughes is a regional director of the National Socialist Movement, a White-supremacist neo-Nazi group.
Boston piled on in the eighth inning.
Parents are remarkably bad at detecting their children's lies. In experimental studies of preschoolers, parents were able to detect accurately when their children were lying only 53% of the time—a little better than chance, according to a 2010 study led by Dr. Talwar. That falls to 33% by the time their kids are 6 to 8 years old. And parents of 9- to 11-year-olds have only about a 1 in 4 chance of knowing when their kids are lying.

We demand to be released from the ghetto of separate-but-equal, ignored-yet-despised. Two consenting adults have the right to marry — or is this reserved only for “the faithful”? Consent is the cornerstone of marriage, so heavy it crushes unseemly allegations — and the straight Woody Allen has proved that marriages stranger and less palatable than the union of two loving men or women may still be built upon that foundation.
"Our new online Social Security statement is simple, easy to use and provides people with estimates they can use to plan for their retirement," Social Security Commissioner Michael J. Astrue said.

People should get in the habit of checking their online statement each year around their birthday, for example."

The middle-class thing is what's most important. A person could argue that power and wealth are always concentrated among a privileged few. What was it George Orwell said in "Animal Farm" - all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others?
Aton recently got some good news. The study has been extended 10 years to keep an eye on the long-term effects on 40 people selected from those who were in the trials nationwide. That means she gets the drug for free.
He also remembers his Roman numerals. Except for everything concerning world sports, which as a soccer-crazed man he also has down, Roman numerals are the most essential things a puzzler can know. Then comes the concept of brief names with vowels, which, by the way, applies to dogs too. To wit:
Every 45 days, Iraq veterans from New Jersey board a bus for the ride down the Turnpike and I-95, seeking solace at a memorial to an earlier generation's divisive war, according to a report in the New York Daily News.
But Cruz said a poison pill in the city's proposal is a clause allowing the city "to amend, change or terminate any retirement or other post-employment benefit," a particular concern given that city workers don't earn Social Security benefits.
When Chiang's office first released the data Tuesday morning, they reported the top earner as a prison system psychiatrist who made $838,706 last year. But later in the day, Jacob Roper, a spokesman for the controller, said that figure was erroneous. State officials are reviewing the payroll data and will update it as soon as possible, he said. Without that psychiatrist, Chiang's database cites the top earner as a prison surgeon who made $777,423 before taxes.

In Paris, the 32-member commission set up by parliament, with members from France's four major political parties, will hold hearings that could lead to legislation banning burqas from being worn in public – a move a top human rights group said would be counterproductive.

After wandering through the Plaza Machado, sneaking looks into private courtyards, I peaked into the recently restored Teatro de Angela Peralta (you may know it as the Opera House), where Handel's "Messiah" was playing. In the ballet studio next door, 21 teenage girls and one boy in toe shoes were at the bar, practicing their routines. As the pianist banged out a tune, the maestro herself — stern and imposing — went from one to the next, raising a leg higher there and arching an arm back here. The scene spoke of a tranquil lifestyle. But it didn't mean I had forgotten to stay alert.
In his second season, Collins had already led the Sixers to their first winning season in seven years. Now, it's on to the second round for the first time since Allen Iverson was an All-Star.
Just when the movie seems unrelentingly grim, however, things take an unlikely turn for the better. Last Days Here heads north on I-95, and Liebling miraculously meets a much younger woman from Philadelphia who finds his charms irresistible. For a while, anyway.

We all know that reality television is that often more in name than in fact. Reports have long surfaced about "missed" scenes re-shot for the cameras or scenarios set up for the benefit of the audience. At this point, it is unknown just how much of that goes on in this particular show. But as with the old scientific maxim - the very act of observing something changes it - so too do I wonder if the very act of observing these kids' lives has changed them. They certainly seem busier than my family.

Watching closely, once again, will be President Obama, whose re-election campaign is welcoming visitors to his website to pick the winners. No wagering please, though anyone visiting the site is invited to donate money to Obama<U+0092>s campaign.
GOP candidates don't like federal mandates that infringe on the religious freedom for which the United States was founded. I am proud to live in a country where people are free to worship as they choose, dress and display symbols according to religious beliefs, and not forced to defy religious beliefs such as not working on the Sabbath. A federal mandate on financing contraceptives through insurance plans administered by Catholic institutions does take away that religious freedom.
In another game, Greer noticed that one team was doubling LaMarcus Aldridge in a way that left Miller wide open in the corner. Greer suggested an offensive tweak that shifted Miller to the weakside and Nicolas Batum -- a much better three-point shooter -- to the opening in the corner.

Some experts cautioned that the jury is out about whether the new unity government will set Netanyahu on a more moderate course, even though President Obama and other global leaders might pressure him to move in that direction.

After all, there's nothing wrong with buying $1 billion a day worth of oil from friends. In April, we sent a total of $6.3 billion a day to various nations for goods and services -- and the world sent us some $5 billion for our stuff in return. This is called "trade."
St. Ann Park was hit hard; many large trees and a picnic shelter were destroyed.

There was a time when any major city had at least three to four local department stores, Whitaker said. And each store took pains to identify with local customers. They partnered with civic organizations, ran art contests for children, or opened store auditoriums for community meetings.

Today, finding a niche in a retail environment that is increasingly homogeneous can be a challenge.

On the other side of the equation, though, is the Downstate ignorance about how deeply so many Chicagoans hate guns.

But how to re-create the unstructured, almost improvisational feel of the film? It must have felt like the furthest thing from Broadway. Tiffany said the key, through an initial run in Cambridge, Mass., then an off-Broadway run and then the leap to Broadway, was to have faith in the material, in all its simplicity.
Daikon cake is carb-intensive comfort in a thick white rectangular pancake made from rice flour and daikon, fried crispy on the outside, gelatinously moist on the inside. Think of an almost-gooey-in-the-center pancake, but fatter and more fried and leagues more warming.
“What Does the Bee Do?” gets going with Gillian prancing around in lingerie and muttering some weird, intense allegory about a stag and hounds to the comatose Commodore, who has a stroke when she shoots an arrow at his heart.

Margaret gets the kids ready as family-guy Nucky goes off to his job in Decadentville.
That Wenders chose a choreographer as challenging as Bausch speaks to his own good taste. That he illustrates, illuminates and renders her sometimes inaccessible work so much more accessible speaks to his sensitivities as a viewer of dance and his genius as a filmmaker.

Wages aren't rising fast enough to keep up with inflation. Rising gas prices are also weighing on consumers' ability to spend money on other goods and services.

Your mentioning your wedding, for which you presumably did not receive such china, and your use of that uppercase "C" both suggest that you have made something of a fetish item of what are, after all, dishes.

-- Los Angeles Times: Neeson holds it together from first to last. He is the rumbly voiced king of the late-January/early February action film, per "Taken" and "Unknown," and by now moviegoers have been subliminally conditioned to pay money to hear that warm hearth of a speaking voice, under duress but coolly so, this time of year. Call "The Grey" "Deliverance"-lite, with snow, and wolves. And call it a solid January surprise.
"We see a lot of leather and skin," Isaac said. Still, he said, it's not that risqué. Bikefest is more laid back then, for example, Daytona Beach's Bike Week.
Menendez’ plan also called for increasing incentives for adoption of natural gas vehicles; accelerating deployment of electric vehicles; keeping American oil in the U.S., rather than exporting it, and ending billions of dollars in tax breaks for big oil.

"It's crazy," says Peachey, who runs a dating website based in Miami. "If taxes go up even more, they'll kill the dream for many people, especially for a family that wants to travel."
But do the Blues have enough to keep pace with Detroit? Wednesday's victory pulled them even with the Red Wings atop the Central Division. The winner of the division will be guaranteed one of the top three seeds in the Western Conference, while the runner-up could finish only as high as fourth. The top four seeds receive home-ice advantage, and for the Blues, who are 26-4-4 at Scottrade Center and 14-13-3 on the road, that could be critical.

"We've traded better pitchers," Manny Acta said shrugging, meaning the trades of Cliff Lee and C.C. Sabathia weren't a reflection on them as pitchers. True, though inadvertently hinting that Jimenez is no Lee or Sabathia is probably not the best argument to make after an organization traded its top two prospects to get him. He'd better be darn close.

That challenge, coming on the back of Mr. Romney's tax release, was all the more reason for him to change the narrative by seizing on a big idea like comprehensive tax reform. He could have underlined how the tax code that Mr. Obama wants to further contort only undermines growth and leaves average Americans paying a higher effective rate than does Mr. Romney. Instead, he complained that Mr. Gingrich's tax simplification plan would let off rich guys.

The idea of starting a science organization came up one night when Aaron and I were sharing memories of our grandfathers, who have Alzheimer's disease. We began to throw out ideas for combating the disease; ideas as immature as stimulating the circadian rhythm and as complex as activating endogenous stem cells bounced back and forth. We soon found ourselves inspired, fascinated and excited, and we wanted to spread the passion and wonder we found to our friends.

In fact, I could type much more quickly and accurately with the iPad's built-in virtual keyboard. I reckoned that it was because of the downsized keys. This put me off of keyboard cases as a basic category.

I think that the rail authority must be preserved, at least as a role model for the other government agencies. It must be given reasonable financing and some easily done duties, such as generating one new project a year. Of course, there is a risk that some hot head in the authority will try to start building a real railroad, but I am sure this person will be rendered harmless by the forces inside the rail authority. Nobody with good sense cuts the branch on which he sits. And until now, the rail authority has demonstrated an astonishing self-preservation instinct.

Barry Bonds always will be a Hall of Fame candidate. He surely is one of the 10 best players of his generation and probably several others. But will he be a Hall of Famer? That is a question I don't have to worry about answering for another three years or so, until he would become eligible. The biggest question of all, though, may be how would the Hall of Famers receive Bonds if he were elected?. My guess is not very well. American is a forgiving nation but Bonds, and for that matter, Roger Clemens, have shown very little if any contrition for their actions or suspected actions. That creates the sense that they feel they are bigger than the game. And they're not.

The Answer: There are a few of them. One is that we always have the right answer, which we don't. Secondly, that it's a really, really tough job, because some days it isn't that tough. But other days, it's not an easy job. People think, "Well, anybody can be the boss." But there are days when it actually is pretty tough. . . . In any job, there are some days you get paid too much, some days you don't get paid enough, and hopefully, most days it just works out right.

It is less a comment on marriage than on the notion that marriage is the holy grail of a woman's existence, the finish line of her life's hopes, dreams and goals. That is a fable upon which the Walt Disney Company built an empire. But the fable is not confined to the multiplex. To the contrary, you can see it played out on a weekly basis in the headlines of any given publication in your local supermarket checkout line.

Pilots have a fair bit of free time when they're not flying, and so Jones was able to develop several other businesses, including Air Hollywood, the leading aviation mockup soundstage used for movies, television shows and commercials, and a venture importing and exporting cars. Lin answered an ad for a car in 1983, became friends with Jones and got him interested in an Asian pear farm in a remote area near Warner Springs.

"We're mentally tougher. We've talked a lot about the adversity we've gone through throughout the course of the season. When things are getting tough on us as a group, we stick to our systems well," forward Matt Hendricks said.

Partnering with Teach for America will strengthen the hiring pool for many of our highest-need schools and subjects. Moreover, the organization will help us keep homegrown leaders who decide to join Teach for America here in our great city of Cleveland.

In my experience, school districts want to partner with Teach for America because it creates a pipeline of talented teachers and leaders eager to work in the most challenging settings.

• Bob Condotta, Seattle Times: Sunday practice notes: rankly, there's not a lot to report. Everything personnel-wise seemed status quo. What stuck out the most was the play of quarterback Keith Price. He won't be 100 percent for the Alamo Bowl --- it's best to realize now that likely won't happen until he has some rest and real time to heal after the season (and maybe a little procedure along the way). But he looked great throwing the ball and running around a little better than he has most of the season.

Let's zero in on what I consider the most important group: bargain hotels. As with overall bests, separate lists cover the world, the United States, the same seven regions, and most of the same 30 individual countries. Here, the world's top spot is the HueNino in Hue, Vietnam -- a result that many of us who knew the Vietnam War as a national nightmare will no doubt find ironic. But at least the SeaCoast Inn in Hyannis makes it to number three.
As I write about in my book "Race and Liberty," these old-style liberals – like their counterparts today (think Ward Connerly) – believed in individual freedom, Christianity, the Constitution, colorblindness and capitalism.

Marriage between a man and a woman has its origins firmly grounded in the objective reality of human nature. Our human reason informs us that man and woman are made for each other. They complement each other physically and socially. Only the sexual union of a man and a woman can bring a new life into the world.

Quinn also proposes making school districts, community colleges and universities pay a small part of the cost of their employees' pensions. Most pay nothing now.

Meanwhile, KSCO, a talk station out of Santa Cruz (at 1080 AM), welcomed all the KGO hosts to go on its air; several made appearances and Wattenburg did a week of morning drive. "The owner's asked me to do a regular show," he told me, adding that he'd heard from 16 stations "hungry to have the kind of nighttime talk radio that I did. ... I'll probably end up doing a syndicated show on weekends." Taliaferro said he'd been contacted by three stations, adding, "I'm weighing my options." Gross did some fill-in work for syndicated talk host Michael Smirconish late last month.
Description: This dense, broadleaf evergreen is an acid-soil-loving shrub with a height and spread of about 6 feet. The early spring, creamy white flowers hang in pendulous clusters and resemble those of the lily-of-the-valley. A special attraction is the fiery red, new spring growth.

Of the few regrets I took away from the ride, one was the noticeable lack of an educational side to the tour. Guides spoke ad nauseam of their training and the redundancies upon redundancies that made this zip line safe but had little to say about the various species we passed overhead. (This information, Gatorland staff assured me, would be included in the tours soon.)
"Because of that flow coming down the river, we will be close to flood stage all summer. That's then new normal," said Wes Browning, chief of the local Weather Service office in Weldon Spring. "But if we get much above normal rainfall, or big bursts of rain, there's likely to be trouble."

Dear Friendship: There's a lot of room between those two choices you offer, because they represent the extremes -- refuse to get involved or get overinvolved in her choices. They also have one important thing in common: Both "forget about her" and "confront her" are punitive responses to the choices she made.

Since 2001, Tinariwen has been one of Africa’s top exports, earning such famous fans as Robert Plant and U2 guitarist The Edge. A collective of Touareg musicians from the Sahara in northern Mali, Tinariwen plays a raw, hypnotic “desert blues,” an organic 21st-century hybrid driven by electric guitars that connects nomadic Africa with the West. A protest band at heart, the group hasn’t bent its native vision to pop interests. But Tinariwen’s fourth album on the World Village label — produced with grit and beauty by Frenchman Jean-Paul Romann, an original intimate — boasts an array of textures, from bone-deep electric grooves and moon-lit acoustic reveries to ecstatic, ululated chants and the U2-like grandeur of “Ere Tasfata Adounia.” The CD comes with a bonus DVD featuring a wonderfully atmospheric half-hour documentary on the Saharan sessions.

Scott Whyte, Peoria's economic development director, said market conditions triggered the changes, as land and home values dropped, and high unemployment led to a high housing inventory amid reduced demand.

In the wild, a coyote has a life span of 10 to 14 years, but just over 20 percent make it to adulthood. October or November is when most pups are mature enough to forage on their own, but those young, inexperienced animals are especially vulnerable. A car apparently hit the coyote I saw. I'll never know if it was a young adult just starting or a mature animal that left behind a mate and family.

It's a fitting postscript to the Christmas Eve message: "And on earth, peace." Not just for some, but for all. Not just for the strong, but also for the weak.

Likewise, with prophetic eyes, the octogenarian Anna beholds the pint-sized Messiah and immediately begins to spread the news about the child's birth.

The pretty Hampshire village is where Austen was born in the rectory of her father's church in 1775. Like many places that have an early connection with a famous person's life, Steventon has less to offer the fan than hoped. It was the incubator of Austen's talents, but her literary life really started after she left town. The 13th century St. Nicholas church where her father was vicar still stands, though the rectory was torn down in 1828. The church bells are a 1995 gift from the Jane Austen Society of North America. Life in the small village shaped her country-centric attitudes. The Vyne, a great house in nearby Basingstoke that is now maintained by the National Trust, was the scene of the kind of parties that populate her books. Austen's father's decision to retire from the church and move in 1801 to the busy, expensive city of Bath came as culture shock to Austen, then 26. In what may be an apocryphally melodramatic story, Jane is said to have fainted dead away when her father broke what he thought was the happy news.

(05-01) 06:48 PDT WASHINGTON (AP) --
While I’m happy to concede that I’m among those who believes that taxes have to be part of the solution to California’s troubles, there are a couple of factual assertions by those who disagree that are simply wrong. For instance, a number of readers argued that California state spending has increased in recent years. That’s false. General fund spending by the state government has bumped up and down a bit in recent years, but it was $102 billion in 2007-08, and is projected at $85.9 billion in the current fiscal year. So taxes may or may not end up being part of the solution, but they won’t be in lieu of cuts.

Alas, I wasn't able to run extensive battery tests of the new iPad's LTE mobile broadband, due to the rarity of LTE around my home and office here in New England. I counted myself lucky to encounter one or two bars of coverage, and the iPad download at about 8 megabits per second.
Methods vary. I tried more than a dozen recipes searching for the method I liked best. Several were more complicated than what I've described <U+0096> managing all the individual components, at times hovering over the stove with a thermometer in one hand and a timer in the other, etc. <U+0096> and it finally dawned on me (after I'd set my alarm so I could wake up on time to check on a batch of cheese incubating in the oven) that perhaps things need not be this complicated.

Dear K.A.: Hang your leather pants in a cool closet, but do not cover them with a plastic bag, as leather must breathe or it will become dry and brittle. Try to avoid having your pants dry-cleaned as long as possible, and then take them only to a leather specialist. The solvents used in regular dry cleaning will cause the leather to stiffen and lose its luster. For surface soil, smooth leather can be wiped with a damp cloth.

June is an especially endearing place to sit with a cocktail and nibble your way through sausage-stuffed cabbage or smoked tuna belly in bagna cauda, and there is a polished, often highly occupied bar open for such activity.

What does Scott do tonight, and for the next few games? None of the aforementioned options appeal to him. Perhaps he gives rookie power forward Tristan Thompson some time in the pivot.

Lt. Eric Shuhandler is the second Gilbert police officer to die in the line of duty.
Hey, Jason: My biggest knock on Shurmur is that he tried to go from Point A to Point D without touching Points B and C. By that I mean he gave Colt McCoy too much responsibility right off the bat. I think he should have leaned on the running game he inherited early to help the offensive line and McCoy settle into a rhythm together. I do think the absence of the off-season minicamps with his new team has much to do with the slow development of the offense.

In the slow-go low-range mode, all the usual strengths offered by the TRD setup - big tires, skid plating, traction control, locking differential, low range - are still strongly in play, with the extra bonus of a touch more wheel travel at each corner. TRD engineers, we're told, worked long and hard to squeeze out every millimeter of full-droop and full-compression wheel travel as possible by tuning the front and rear springs and paying close attention to the progressive bump-stops. The added articulation and strong grip of our BFGs made short work of several steep off-camber hill climbs (by our calculations, about a 30-degree slope - almost a 70-percent grade) that made our seat belt tensioners cut into our shoulder as we climbed the rutted grade to the crest.

_ "Alien" (1979): This belongs at the top of about five different lists, including best thriller and best horror film, as well. Ridley Scott did so many things right here — from the grimy, lived-in world of the Nostromo mixed with H.R. Giger's eerily seductive design to the perfect cast and Sigourney Weaver's bad-ass performance. I also love the way Scott keeps the alien unseen for so much of the gut-churning build up, then delivers one of the most terrifying creatures ever seen on screen. I still can't watch this one after about 8 p.m.

But next time you look in the mirror and see that distinctive "protuberance of flesh above the waistband of a tight pair of trousers," (to quote the OED) you should try saying "muffin top" with a little love, says Jean Fain, author of "The Self-Compassion Diet", and a practicing psychotherapist who teaches at Harvard Medical School. That might be a better way of losing that unwanted protuberance than the usual ways in which women talk about the parts of their bodies they would like to change, tighten, shape or lose, she says.
NEW YORK — CC Sabathia wriggled his left shoulder out of the backpack-sized ice wrap and let out a sigh of relief as he dropped it into a hamper full of dirty laundry at the back end of the clubhouse.

Healthy sperm and a robust sperm count improve your odds that a single sperm will survive its ultra-marathon journey and meet an eligible egg. And sperm have different functions. Some act like blockers to stop other sperm, which makes "survival of the fittest" sense for animals with multiple mates during rutting season, while others are sprinters designed to beat a path to the egg. More than half of a guy's sperm are the sprinter/swimmer type and those oval heads need to be strong enough to break through an egg's tough outer layer.

Andrew Luck, Stanford, 6-4, 234: Luck is a complete prospect with experience, a history of production, a feel for the game, size, athleticism, top intangibles and toughness. He doesn't have an arm like John Elway's, but it's good enough — similar to Manning's, and he throws as accurately. His movement skills are similar to Jay Cutler's and he can throw on the run. He can take a hit like Cutler. Luck has shown he can work through his progressions and find second and third options. He has produced for four years and is considered NFL-ready. There is very little chance Luck will be a bust, and an excellent chance he will be a Pro Bowl caliber player.

Will 2012 finally be the year when the camera industry settles on one name for a common next-generation style of camera? They'd better get hopping.

As physicians in training, we see contraception as an essential component of effective primary care, not as a political line item in Washington or the Vatican.

Prince also came oh-so-close to playing in the U.S. Women's Open, but lost in a playoff in a sectional qualifier at Royal Oaks in Vancouver in May. She seemed to have a spot sewed up when she hit her approach on the second playoff hole to four feet, but competitor Sue Kim of Canada chipped in for birdie, and although Prince made her birdie putt, Kim won the playoff two holes later.

At that point, Rutgers was still a fledgling Big East team, trying to come back from a 1-5 start. Then Mike Teel went on an aerial assault, throwing for 361 yards and six touchdowns in Pittsburgh. Kenny Britt finished with 143 yards and three touchdowns. This could be seen as the springboard for seven straight wins to end what looked at one point to be a disastrous season that would end with a PapaJohns.com Bowl win over North Carolina State.

EHRs are, logically enough, computerized records of the care you receive. They allow health care professionals to easily assess your medical history, order and review needed tests, monitor results over time and measure the care they provide against nationally endorsed standards for quality treatment.

Black Oregonians are particularly vulnerable to recession, says Gibson of Portland State.
Debates have turned facile superiority into an art form. The charade of engagement is so popular with the candidates because they can deflect any question that pushes their feet toward the fire. On the one occasion that moderator Tracy Barry invited follow-up -- "It's just getting interesting," she said, on the argument over the long-term support Bonamici and her husband, Michael Simon, had for David Wu -- no one grabbed the mike.

As far as the concertos go, "Rachmaninoff was one of the greatest pianists of all time," Hough says. "He writes for the keyboard and the piano in the most astonishing ways.

3:25 p.m.: I finished off my ornament with a tiny silver ribbon bow. Everyone was kind enough to say it looked nice, and that it would make a good gift tag.
What followed was a heightening of this ethos: Aldo Leopold helped champion the emerging field of ecology; a 1964 federal Wilderness Act protected 9.1 million acres in 54 parks (now 110 million acres over 757 sites); and the first Earth Day arrived, even as it oddly supplanted the April 22 celebration of Arbor Day in many states.

Arizona had Harvey Houses, and Harvey girls, in Ash Fork, Flagstaff, Seligman, Williams, Winslow and on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. Today, only the magnificent El Tovar at the Canyon and La Posada in Winslow are still in business.
But Daldry brings nothing else to them – not a sudden insight, not a surprising choice, not a single perfect image. And the film’s final shot – a joyous freeze-frame – is as painfully predictable as are the undeserved sniffles in the audience.
Obese people are often told by health experts to walk, said Deusinger. "That turns out to be a very difficult instruction when you're not able to move normally anyway."

One of the appetizerlike dishes is a takeoff on hot artichoke dip that subs in fava beans as a thickener and flavor agent, with a mozzarella, goat and cream cheese combination bulking it up. The artichoke "heart" component in the menu description materialized as individual leaves and bits of the heart, but the artichoke flavor was fully in evidence, and the dish was one of those that compelled revisiting until every last bit was gone.
The latest episode is the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) mandate to restrict religious freedom in the name of mandated so-called health-care provisions. It is attempting to redefine what a religion may or may not hold as a right.

By asserting that the very purpose of faith -- and the "core struggle of human nature" -- is to strive for closer adherence to the "law of love" in our relations with one another, Obama essentially neutralizes religious difference. Whatever one's belief system -- whether religious or secular -- it all boils down to the same crystallized essence: an "irreducible" something, as he puts it, which is simple and universal. It is the common ideal embodied in the Golden Rule.
"People can really wear on your nerves," he says of the album's concept. "I'm learning how to not hold grudges, how to really be your brother's keeper, and understanding none of us are perfect. We each have our own journey."
Gobezie has performed the procedure, which uses donated cadaver cartilage, on four patients to date.

Let's hope "The New Zach Braff" learns from the original Zach Braff to strike while the iron is hot and not dither away his potential waiting for that perfect "next project" to come along. For filmmakers, there is but one life lesson -- you don't get better by sitting around waiting.

"Firefighters get orders to risk their lives in buildings that are on fire," Szabo said. "When they get clear orders, they follow them.

“With my sidearm approach,” he said, “90 percent of the time, my ball is sinking. It’s easy for me to keep the ball down because of the way I throw and the action the ball gets.”
That could mean gambling on more costly projects. The water authority recently decided to spend about $400,000 analyzing a concept that was last assessed a decade ago: delivering water from Imperial irrigators to San Vicente Reservoir near Lakeside. The idea is to bypass Metropolitan's pipes for part of the local supply, though San Diego still would rely on MWD to make deliveries from other sources.
