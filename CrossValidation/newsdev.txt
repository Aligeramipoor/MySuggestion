“It’s a wonderful impersonation,” a critic said to me as we left the screening, and I noted the choice of words, and the old charge against Streep – it’s all technique, no feeling. But this is more than mere mimicry. This is a true, bravura performance – one of the best of the year in, sadly, a film that remains solidly in the middle of the pack.
"What's surprising is the breadth of support that these (issues) are the most important to children's health and the consensus that it's up to the community <U+0096> not just the parents <U+0096> to be involved," said Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo.

Use all your senses: Judging beer is a science, and Pat Daniels -- one of the most knowledgeable tasters around -- offers an excellent guide: bjcp.org/docs/How_to_Judge_Beer.pdf. "All five human senses can and should be used when judging officially or casually," says Daniels, a bartender at McNulty's Bier Markt. And yes, that includes hearing: "I know what you're thinking.

When judging or casually drinking from beer poured from the bottle, I have started the process with many styles such as a highly carbonated Belgian Gueuze and Tripel that should present the sound of massive amounts of CO2 escaping from the bottle (like popping champagne) after being opened. Unfortunately, my ears are the first to detect that such a bottle has gone flat and lost this sought-after carbonation that helps makes the style."

Ian Stuart, STM's dominant lineman, has had Padua on his list of potential high schools from the start. His older sister Margo is a junior there, so finding transportation wouldn't be difficult. He particularly likes that Padua has girls -- a benefit helping to balance out the fact that the high school has a less prominent football history than all-boys schools such as St. Ignatius or St. Edward.

Tony's take: Too much riding on it for Ravens to stumble. Ravens, 27-17.
"The Artist": Michel Hazanavicius's mostly silent, entirely black-and-white romantic comedy is pleasing in many ways: as a love letter to the movies, a tribute to the power of silence, and a showcase for two actors, Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo, who've taken their retro roles seriously and played them eloquently.
And last year, it got a guilty plea and eventual consecutive life prison sentences for Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 24-year-old Nigerian student turned Al-Qaida operative, for trying to detonate a bomb in his underwear on a Detroit-bound jetliner on Christmas Day 2009.

But never fear -- the Manly Housekeeper is here.
Afghan and American officials finalized the text of the document on Sunday after a year and a half of negotiations during which it often seemed that the deal was likely to fall apart. They went through 23 drafts before both sides were finally satisfied, Spanta said.

* Tamia Roberts, 19, of Sheridan Avenue in Atlantic City, was arrested Sunday and charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance.
There was a time when any major city had at least three to four local department stores, Whitaker said. And each store took pains to identify with local customers. They partnered with civic organizations, ran art contests for children, or opened store auditoriums for community meetings. Recently, shoppers have been saddened to see their hometown store brands gobbled up by corporate conglomerates. Today, finding a niche in a retail environment that is increasingly homogeneous can be a challenge.
“What Does the Bee Do?” gets going with Gillian prancing around in lingerie and muttering some weird, intense allegory about a stag and hounds to the comatose Commodore, who has a stroke when she shoots an arrow at his heart. Chalky is out of jail (hooray!) and dealing with the social-climbing aspirations of his wife and family. Richard, longing for a home, gazes at Angela. Margaret gets the kids ready as family-guy Nucky goes off to his job in Decadentville.
"We see a lot of leather and skin," Isaac said. Still, he said, it's not that risqué. Bikefest is more laid back then, for example, Daytona Beach's Bike Week.

2935 Delaware Dr, $112,500
Michael says she originally entered the Congressional race based on one issue - abortion. But now that she is "meeting people and kissing babies" she has greater interest in being a well-rounded candidate.
That challenge, coming on the back of Mr. Romney's tax release, was all the more reason for him to change the narrative by seizing on a big idea like comprehensive tax reform. He could have underlined how the tax code that Mr. Obama wants to further contort only undermines growth and leaves average Americans paying a higher effective rate than does Mr. Romney. Instead, he complained that Mr. Gingrich's tax simplification plan would let off rich guys.
On the Ohio State game back in December:
As he counts, I remember how this journey began. On Oct. 22, 2008 a friend shared her experience of donating a kidney to her husband. As she spoke, a voice challenged me, "Why not you?"
From 1968 to 1974, Os Mutantes released a half-dozen albums before lineup changes, government pressure and excessive use of LSD led to the group's demise. But with DJs such as Gilles Peterson releasing compilations featuring Tropicalia artists, and mainstream cultural figures such as David Byrne, Beck and the Flaming Lips trumpeting Os Mutantes' significance and influence, the band and its style have made a comeback. McDonald's even used the Os Mutantes classic "A Minha Menina" in a recent ad.

Still, whatever hurdles pool operators face will ensure fewer obstacles for thousands of disabled swimmers.
Komen announced late Tuesday it would no longer fund Planned Parenthood affiliates because the organization is under congressional investigation. It’s a major blow. Planned Parenthood received $680,000 from Komen last year, according to one report.

But even as Sullivan admitted he might have been involved in the cases, there was little chance he could have been charged with crimes. That's because the questions resulted from interviews with other drug users who had no details to support the allegations.
It's a painful trade-off -- green energy vs. bird deaths -- and one many birders cannot support.
He also said signing Holmes to a five-year, $45 million deal was not a mistake and reiterated that the team will fix the issues that contributed to its disappointing season, starting with better communication.

That's too bad, but the whole thing was a risk. If you're going to tinker with a classic, you don't have much room for error. "Dorothy and the Witches of Oz" is proof.
Balafas said that in the first of those domestic-violence incidents, in August 2011, Ready claimed to be the victim, though Balafas did not say of whom. In the second, which according to Balafas took place in February, Lisa Mederos claimed that Ready choked her.

It's clearly not working. Washington has only succeeded in pushing drug cartels from Colombia to Mexico, and now -- increasingly -- from Mexico to Central America. If we drive them out of Central America, they will go to the Caribbean. It's a never-ending game that is costing billions of dollars, and tens of thousands of innocent lives.
One spot grabbed me, though: A sign near 159th Street and Ridgeview Avenue in Kansas City, Kan., marks a spot where the Sante Fe and Oregon trails intersect. I imagined us in a covered wagon, not a Kia Sorento. Go West, old men.
"Do I want more physical play inside and more physical play all the way around? Yeah," Greatwood said. "But the bottom line is that we've got the kids that we've got and we have to find a way to make them work against the LSUs of the world."
Brewer's campaign and gubernatorial staff bristled Tuesday at the suggestion that the governor has not made illegal immigration and border security a priority since taking office.
"We're mentally tougher. We've talked a lot about the adversity we've gone through throughout the course of the season. When things are getting tough on us as a group, we stick to our systems well," forward Matt Hendricks said. "We don't deviate away from them, the way we used to, where we'd get down a goal or two and we'd get 'individual.' We'd try to do things on our own. (Now) we're relying on our system, on our teammates, and it's benefiting us."

Her performance tonight was amazing. She controls the stage very well and her voice is great."

Partnering with Teach for America will strengthen the hiring pool for many of our highest-need schools and subjects. Moreover, the organization will help us keep homegrown leaders who decide to join Teach for America here in our great city of Cleveland. Like in the other 43 communities where the organization works, Teach for America teachers will interview alongside other candidates for open positions and, if hired, become school district employees. In my experience, school districts want to partner with Teach for America because it creates a pipeline of talented teachers and leaders eager to work in the most challenging settings.
"We demand kids do the little things the right way and we teach those things are important in life, not just football," Mihalik said of all three CVC teams.

Still, look again with a suspicious mind at the new Ohio congressional districts Statehouse Republicans drew. (The political Picasso was most likely U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, whose 8th District looks like a vise with Montgomery County in its jaws.)
Description: This dense, broadleaf evergreen is an acid-soil-loving shrub with a height and spread of about 6 feet. The early spring, creamy white flowers hang in pendulous clusters and resemble those of the lily-of-the-valley. A special attraction is the fiery red, new spring growth. The narrow, dark green leaves are about 3 inches long.

If you prefer a more country-fried music fest, Bama Jam is the place to go nearest to Atlanta this season. The festival takes place in southern Alabama (or "L.A.," as locals are fond of saying, for lower Alabama) outside the small town of Enterprise.

In the wild, a coyote has a life span of 10 to 14 years, but just over 20 percent make it to adulthood. October or November is when most pups are mature enough to forage on their own, but those young, inexperienced animals are especially vulnerable. A car apparently hit the coyote I saw. I'll never know if it was a young adult just starting or a mature animal that left behind a mate and family.

The person said Umenyiora’s surgery was performed at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York by orthopedic surgeon Brian Kelly. The expected recovery time is three months, which means Umenyiora would be working his way back to top shape in late April. He might be limited in offseason workouts and organized team activities – provided, of course, both will take place under a new collective bargaining agreement. In the event of a lockout, Umenyiora and all players would work out on their own.
Under that plan, all school districts - rich, poor, those that are held harmless and those on the formula - would bear an equal cut.
Fortunately, there is an alternative: Canyon X, a slightly deeper, more remote and far less visited than Antelope Canyon, lies just a few miles away.
In the slow-go low-range mode, all the usual strengths offered by the TRD setup - big tires, skid plating, traction control, locking differential, low range - are still strongly in play, with the extra bonus of a touch more wheel travel at each corner. TRD engineers, we're told, worked long and hard to squeeze out every millimeter of full-droop and full-compression wheel travel as possible by tuning the front and rear springs and paying close attention to the progressive bump-stops. The added articulation and strong grip of our BFGs made short work of several steep off-camber hill climbs (by our calculations, about a 30-degree slope - almost a 70-percent grade) that made our seat belt tensioners cut into our shoulder as we climbed the rutted grade to the crest.

Andrew Luck, Stanford, 6-4, 234: Luck is a complete prospect with experience, a history of production, a feel for the game, size, athleticism, top intangibles and toughness. He doesn't have an arm like John Elway's, but it's good enough — similar to Manning's, and he throws as accurately. His movement skills are similar to Jay Cutler's and he can throw on the run. He can take a hit like Cutler. Luck has shown he can work through his progressions and find second and third options. He has produced for four years and is considered NFL-ready. There is very little chance Luck will be a bust, and an excellent chance he will be a Pro Bowl caliber player.

He figures he'll be $32,000 in debt by the end of his sophomore year and worries about getting "tapped out" and unable to finance his graduate studies.
They're also growing quite accustomed to playing tight ones: 10 of their 11 playoff games have been decided by one goal, and only once has Washington scored as many as four. It's quite a long way from when they were winning playoff games by scores of 4-0 or 5-3 _ and, incidentally, never making it beyond the second round.

Using a signature to verify a person's identity in order for a provisional to count is unreliable, especially in cases of elderly voters who registered many years earlier and whose signature likely looks very different, said Denise Lieberman, a spokeswoman for Missourians for Fair Elections.
